"""Airspeed Velocity arms for the literature head-to-head.

Each timed method is one call. The median, the interquartile range and
the per-atom agreement are the Snakemake rule ``literature_h2h``, which
runs ``scripts/h2h_literature.py`` for eight samples in one session.
Serial is cpu 0. Eight threads are cpus 0-7.
