# Paper-review head-to-head

One session on 8 cores. Eight alternating samples. Serial calls are pinned to core 0. Eight-thread calls use cores 0-7, with `OMP_PROC_BIND=close`, `OMP_PLACES=cores`, and `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE`. A win is a strictly smaller median and a strictly smaller minimum. OVITO is 3.17.2. The raw log is `benchmarks/h2h-paper-review.txt`.

The recorded losses below are the numbers from the review. They are not from this session. This session did not reproduce them.

## Before and after, milliseconds

Median, then minimum. The ring and symmetry rows are this host against OVITO. The cage rows are the library signature against the `seams` command.

Every row on this host is a win. Ideal ice is hexagonal on every atom for both symmetry codes (4096 of 4096, 110592 of 110592). The cage census is 4096 cages at both thread counts.

## Rings and symmetry

The ring path and the symmetry classifier are unchanged. These ring rows time `seams_rings_find`, which builds the cutoff graph, against a pipeline that reruns `CreateBondsModifier` and `FindRingsModifier`. The rings-only boundary, with both graphs built first, is `benchmarks/h2h-ice-ic-rings.csv`. On this host the census and `seams_system_symmetry` (shell RMSD ceiling 0.15, the caller passes 0) are faster than OVITO FindRings and IdentifyDiamond at 136, 4096, and 110592 molecules, at one thread and at eight. The recorded 865 ms against 511 ms did not recur. The symmetry headline had no source in the tree, so that recorded cell is omitted. The identify-diamond times above are this script.

## Library cages

`seams_cages_signature` copied the whole frame, including the atom-id map, and rebuilt the cutoff graph through atom ids. A typed call now keeps the caller's cloud, and an orthorhombic single-type frame builds the graph with the cell-list CSR. One thread searches the packed rows. A team searches the per-atom vectors, which is the layout the command uses. A tilted cell still uses the neighbour-list builder, because the tilted cell list is not the same pair set.

The sII 8x8x8 frame (69632 molecules, orthorhombic) returns 4096 cages of signature `51264` from the library and from `seams cages`. The sI unit cell returns 2 cages of `512`. The tilted sH cell, with the LAMMPS edges and the xy tilt, returns 12 cages of `512` and 4 of `51268`, the same counts as the command.

## CHILL+

Thresholds are unchanged. The published rule is Nguyen and Molinero, JPCB 119, 9369 (2015): the four nearest neighbours, staggered when `c_ij <= -0.35`, eclipsed when `-0.8 <= c_ij <= 0.25`. The OVITO rule uses every neighbour inside 3.5 A and the open edges (`c_ij < -0.35`, `-0.8 < c_ij < 0.25`). That option is `SEAMS_CHILL_OVITO` / `rule="ovito"`, already on this branch. `tests/test_ovito_chill_atoms.py` compares it with OVITO 3.17.2 `ChillPlusModifier` on every atom.

The mW recall pair 0.902 against 0.862, and the TIP4P pairs 0.975/0.970 against 0.966/0.944, are not recomputed here. Those labeled frames are not in the tree. On the frames that are, the published rule and the OVITO rule agree on ideal Ih, ideal Ic, and the stacking slab. They differ on the interface and the melted slab, which is the four-nearest rule against the 3.5 A neighbour rule. The OVITO rule matches the modifier on every atom of all five frames (0 mismatches).

Rows are `paper label / ovito-rule label = count`, then `ovito-rule / modifier`.

| Ih 512 | hexagonal/hexagonal=512 | hexagonal/hexagonal=512 |
