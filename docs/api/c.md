# C API

`seams.h` is ABI 1 of libseams. A handle is opaque. Coordinates are Angstrom.
A cell is nine numbers: `ox, oy, oz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz`. A zero tilt is orthorhombic.
`lx, ly, lz` are edge lengths.

`docs/examples/minimal_c.c` is the short program. `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c` calls every exported function on the in-tree fixtures.
`meson test docs_c_api_tour` compiles that file, runs it, and requires each printed
`capi` line below to match the run.

## Handle lifecycle

`seams_system_create` allocates an empty frame. The caller owns it and passes it to
`seams_system_destroy`. `NULL` is a valid argument to every destroy function.
`seams_system_set_atoms` stores points and a nine-number cell. Lengths are `size_t`.
`seams_system_set_frame` is the same store with an `int` count.
`seams_system_set_ortho` stores an orthorhombic cell. `seams_system_read` copies one
1-based frame from a trajectory. A negative type filter keeps every atom. A positive
filter keeps that species. `seams_system_count` is the number of points, or 0 for a
null handle. Neighbour, ring, cage, brine, and fingerprint handles are separate
objects. Destroying the frame does not free them.

One thread uses a handle. Another thread may use a different handle at the same time,
including for `seams_ql`, `seams_q4q6`, `seams_q6bar`, and `seams_steinhardt`: their
q_lm scratch belongs to the calling thread. `tests/capi_q_threads.c` runs them, and
CHILL+, on eight handles in eight threads.

## Status codes

`seams_status` is zero on success.

| code | value | `seams_status_string` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SEAMS_OK` | 0 | ok |
| `SEAMS_ERR_NULL` | 1 | null pointer |
| `SEAMS_ERR_RANGE` | 2 | value out of range |
| `SEAMS_ERR_BOX` | 3 | box is not a positive cell |
| `SEAMS_ERR_ARG` | 4 | bad argument |
| `SEAMS_ERR_STATE` | 5 | system has no frame |
| `SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM` | 6 | out of memory |
| `SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL` | 7 | internal error |

No C API call aborts or exits the process. Every C++ exception is caught inside the
library and returned as one of these codes.

## Length-checked entry points

The ABI 1 calls `seams_chill_plus`, `seams_q4q6`, and `seams_rings_labels` write into
buffers without a length, and `seams_rings_histogram` takes an `int` length. New code
calls `seams_chill_plus_n`, `seams_q4q6_n`, `seams_rings_labels_n`, and
`seams_rings_histogram_n`, which take a `size_t` length for every buffer and return
`SEAMS_ERR_RANGE` when one is short. `seams_system_natoms`, `seams_neighbours_nrows`,
and `seams_rings_nrings` return their count through a `size_t` pointer and report a
null or empty handle as a status. The older calls stay exported with the same
behaviour.

## Linking

libseams is compiled with hidden visibility and a linker export list, so the only
exported symbols are the `seams_*` functions in `seams.h`. `SEAMS_API` marks them.
The library build defines `SEAMS_BUILDING`, which selects `dllexport` on Windows;
consumers get `dllimport`. Define `SEAMS_STATIC` before including `seams.h` to link
a static archive. `tests/capi_symbols.txt` is the exported list, and the
`capi_symbols` test compares it with the header and the built library.
`capi_abi` compares the exported names with `scripts/abi_baseline.txt`. When
libabigail's `abidiff` is on `PATH` at configure time, it also builds libseams once
more with debug info and compares its types with the ABI 1 corpus in
`scripts/abi_baseline.abi`: added functions pass, and anything else fails. The
`abi` pixi environment carries conda-forge's libabigail, so
`pixi run -e abi meson setup <builddir>` finds it, and the `capi-abi` CI job runs
that way. Distribution packages work too: `abigail-tools` on Debian and Ubuntu,
`libabigail` on Fedora. The corpus is format 2.4, which libabigail 2.9 and 3.0
read. Without
`abidiff`, or with an older one, `capi_abi` still checks the exported names, says
the type step was skipped, and passes.

## seams_last_error and seams_handle_error

`seams_last_error_message` and its ABI 1 spelling `seams_last_error` return the same
string. `seams_last_error` is the detail of the last failing call on this thread. A later
successful call on the same thread clears it. The storage is thread-local.
`seams_handle_error` is the copy stored on the handle that failed. A call that takes
the handle non-const clears that copy on entry. A call that takes it `const` writes the
copy only when it fails, so a successful `const` call leaves the last failure in place.
The copy stays until the next failing call or non-const call on that handle, or until
destroy. Pass `NULL` and
`seams_handle_error` returns the thread-local string. The caller does not free either
pointer.

On an empty frame, `seams_chill_plus` returns `SEAMS_ERR_STATE`. The tour prints:

```
capi seams_last_error system has no frame
capi seams_handle_error no-frame
```

## Const handles

A function that takes a `const` handle is a read-only accessor. On success it writes
nothing to the handle; on failure it writes only the error copy, under a lock. Several
threads may make `const` calls on one handle at the same time, as long as no non-const
call on that handle overlaps them. Read the message with `seams_last_error_message`
when threads share a handle. `tests/capi_const_threads.c` runs eight threads this way.

The frame accessors are `seams_system_count`, `seams_system_natoms`, `seams_system_box`,
`seams_system_positions`, `seams_system_types`, and `seams_system_ids`. Every query on
a neighbour, ring, cage, brine, or fingerprint handle is also `const`. The ring label
cache that `seams_rings_labels` fills on the first symmetry request is built once,
under a lock.

The analyses on a `seams_system` stay non-const, and each declaration in `seams.h`
says why under "Handle access":

- the loads replace the stored frame;
- `seams_chill`, `seams_chill_plus`, and `seams_chill_plus_n` write CHILL+ labels into
  the stored frame;
- the others, including `seams_ql`, `seams_q4q6`, `seams_q4q6_n`, `seams_q6bar`, and
  `seams_steinhardt`, keep no scratch on the handle, and are non-const only because
  they clear the error copy on entry, which is what lets `seams_handle_error` report
  that call. The q_lm scratch of the q calls belongs to the calling thread.

## Reloading a frame

`seams_system_set_atoms` reuses the storage of the frame it replaces. When the ids
are `NULL`, or 1 to n in order, and the atom count is unchanged, it also keeps the id
index. `seams_system_set_positions` overwrites only the coordinates, and optionally
the cell, for a frame of the same atom count; types and ids stay. A trajectory loop
calls `seams_system_set_atoms` once and `seams_system_set_positions` for each later
frame. There is no borrowed-pointer load. Every analysis reads the library's per-atom
records, so a view onto caller memory would be copied on every analysis call instead
of once per frame. A failed load or reload leaves the earlier frame in place.
`seams_system_set_positions` keeps that guarantee by checking every coordinate
before it writes any, so it reads the input twice and needs no extra memory. The
check scans from the end of the input, so the write pass finds its start still in
cache. In a trajectory loop a reload then costs 2 to 5% more than writing the
coordinates into the C++ frame directly at 4096 and 110592 molecules, and about 12%
more at 884736, where the second read of the 21 MB input comes from L3.
`seams_system_stage_positions(sys, 1)` makes it read the input once instead: it
writes into a second set of per-atom records, checked in the same pass, and swaps
that set in at the end. That reload stays within 5% of the direct write at each of
those sizes. The set costs about 72 bytes per atom, 15 to 18% of the resident
memory of a process that has loaded an ice frame of 0.1 to 0.9 million molecules
and run CHILL+ on it.

For large frames staged mode is the zero-overhead path. Once the input no longer
fits in L2, the default check costs a full second read of it, and staging is the
only way to read it once. The times below are per reload in a trajectory loop: the
median of 21 batches of 100 calls on one thread, from `bench_capi_overhead`. The
direct write is the C++ loop that writes x, y, z and the label into a built frame.

| molecules | direct write | default | staged |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4096 | 0.0068 ms | 0.0070 ms (+2.3%) | 0.0072 ms (+4.4%) |
| 110592 | 0.3882 ms | 0.4067 ms (+4.8%) | 0.3664 ms (-5.6%) |
| 884736 | 3.1568 ms | 3.5415 ms (+12.2%) | 3.1939 ms (+1.2%) |

Each interquartile range is at most 2.2% of its median. A loop over frames of a
million atoms or more should call `seams_system_stage_positions(sys, 1)` once after
the first `seams_system_set_atoms`, if the extra 72 bytes per atom fit.

## Threads

`seams_set_num_threads(1)` selects one OpenMP thread. `seams_set_num_threads(0)`
restores the library default. A negative width returns `SEAMS_ERR_RANGE`.
`seams_get_num_threads` reports the width the next call will use.
`seams_set_num_threads` is process-global. Do not call it while another thread is
inside `seams_get_num_threads`.

## What the tour runs

The eight-atom cell is the diamond in `docs/examples/ice.c`. Every atom is cubic.
`input/traj/ice1h.lammpstrj` is the 128-oxygen ice Ih cell. `input/traj/genice_sI.lammpstrj`
is the 46-oxygen sI cage. `input/traj/exampleTraj.lammpstrj` is the mixed TIP4P dump
used for hydrogen bonds, sites, and domains. The cutoff is 3.5 angstroms unless a
line below says otherwise.

### seams_brine_analyse

Purpose: Planar ice/brine front from an ice assignment.

ice[i] is non-zero when atom i is ice. water_type 0 keeps every atom whose type is not ion_type. ion_type 0 means the frame has no ions. n_bins 0 selects 20 bins. axis is 0, 1, or 2. The ice fraction cut is 0.5, and the bulk ice and liquid cuts are 0.85 and 0.15.

```c
seams_status seams_brine_analyse(seams_system *sys, const int *ice, size_t n_ice, int water_type, int ion_type, int n_bins, int axis, seams_brine **out);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `ice`, `n_ice`, `water_type`, `ion_type`, `n_bins`, `axis`, `out`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `ice`: Per-atom ice flags, length n_ice.
- `n_ice`: Must equal the frame count.
- `water_type`: Species kept as water, or 0.
- `ion_type`: Species kept as ions, or 0 for none.
- `n_bins`: Bin count along axis, or 0 for 20.
- `axis`: 0, 1, or 2.
- `out`: Receives a new handle. On failure *out is NULL.

Returns: SEAMS_OK, or SEAMS_ERR_NULL, SEAMS_ERR_STATE, SEAMS_ERR_RANGE, SEAMS_ERR_ARG, SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM, SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL.

Handle access: Non-const only because the call clears the handle's error slot on entry, so seams_handle_error() reports this call. It reads the frame and keeps no scratch on the handle.

Ownership: The caller frees *out with seams_brine_destroy().

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_brine *front = NULL;
if (seams_brine_analyse(sys, ice, n, 1, 2, 0, 2, &front) == SEAMS_OK) {
  seams_brine_destroy(front);
}
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

Parameters: `sys`, `k`, `cutoff`, `type`, `mutual`, `out`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `k`: Positive neighbour count.
- `cutoff`: Nominal positive cutoff, Angstrom. Candidates are taken inside cutoff + 1.5.

Handle access: Non-const only because the call clears the handle's error slot on entry; it reads the frame and nothing else on the handle. The q_lm work arrays belong to the calling thread, so calls on different handles may run at the same time.

Ownership: The caller owns q6bar.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys. Any q call on another handle may run beside it.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
double mean = 0, median = 0;

Ownership: The caller owns sys; the call borrows it. spec is read during the call only. n_cages and n_atoms are caller storage that the call fills. The library keeps no pointer to any argument.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
size_t n_cages = 0, n_atoms = 0;
seams_signature_cages(sys, 3.5, 0, SEAMS_GRAPH_CUTOFF, "hc", &n_cages, &n_atoms);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

Handle access: Non-const only because the call clears the handle's error slot on entry, so seams_handle_error() reports this call. It reads the frame and keeps no scratch on the handle.

Ownership: The caller owns kinds.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_site_table(sys, "1=cationHead,2=anion", kinds, n);

```

Parameters: `sys`, `box9`, `box_len`.

int seams_system_count(const seams_system *sys);
```

Parameters: `sys`.

- `sys`: Frame handle, or NULL.

Returns: The atom count, or 0 when sys is NULL or holds no frame.

Ownership: The caller owns sys; the call borrows it. The library keeps no pointer to any argument.

Thread safety: Read-only: may run alongside other const calls on sys, and not alongside a non-const call on sys.

Example:

```c
seams_system *sys = seams_system_create();
if (sys == NULL) { return SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM; }
seams_system_destroy(sys);

### seams_system_destroy

Purpose: Free a frame.

```c
void seams_system_destroy(seams_system *sys);
```

Parameters: `sys`.

- `sys`: Handle from seams_system_create(), or NULL. NULL is ignored.

Ownership: The handle and the frame it stored are released. Neighbour, ring, cage, and brine handles built from it stay valid: they hold their own copies.

Thread safety: The caller must not use sys after this returns, and must not call it concurrently with any use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_system_destroy(sys);
sys = NULL;
```

```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_natoms

```c
seams_status seams_system_natoms(const seams_system *sys, size_t *n);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `n`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `n`: Receives the atom count.

Returns: SEAMS_OK, SEAMS_ERR_NULL when sys or n is NULL, or SEAMS_ERR_STATE when sys holds no frame. *n is unchanged on failure.

Ownership: The caller owns sys; the call borrows it. n is caller storage that the call fills. The library keeps no pointer to any argument.

Thread safety: Read-only: may run alongside other const calls on sys, and not alongside a non-const call on sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
size_t n = 0;
if (seams_system_natoms(sys, &n) == SEAMS_OK) { labels = malloc(n * sizeof *labels); }
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_positions

Purpose: Copy the stored coordinates out.

### seams_system_read

Purpose: Read one frame from a trajectory file.

```c
seams_status seams_system_read(seams_system *sys, const char *path, int frame, int type_filter);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `path`, `frame`, `type_filter`.

- `sys`: Frame handle. On failure the previously stored frame is kept.
- `path`: Filesystem path. CON, LAMMPS dump, and the formats the linked readers accept.
- `frame`: Frame index, 1-based, matching the file order.
- `type_filter`: Negative keeps every atom. Zero guesses the oxygen species. A positive value keeps that species number.

Returns: SEAMS_OK, or SEAMS_ERR_NULL, SEAMS_ERR_RANGE (frame index or empty frame), SEAMS_ERR_ARG (unreadable file), SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM, SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL.

Handle access: Non-const: replaces the stored frame. On failure the old frame stays.

Ownership: The library copies the frame out of the file.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys. Concurrent reads of distinct paths on distinct handles are safe.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_status rc = seams_system_read(sys, "ice.lammpstrj", 1, -1);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_set_atoms

Purpose: Store points and a general cell. Lengths are size_t.

On failure the previously stored frame, if any, is kept. A reload on the same handle reuses its per-atom storage. When `ids` is NULL or 1..n and `n` matches the previous load, the id table is kept as well, so reloading a trajectory frame by frame costs one pass over the input after the finiteness check. seams_system_set_positions() also skips the type and id pass.

```c
seams_status seams_system_set_atoms(seams_system *sys, const double *xyz, size_t n, const double *box9, size_t box_len, const int *types, const int *ids);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `xyz`, `n`, `box9`, `box_len`, `types`, `ids`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `xyz`: n times 3 Cartesian coordinates, Angstrom. Every value must be finite.
- `n`: Atom count. Zero is rejected. A count that does not fit in the frame's integer width is rejected.
- `box9`: Cell numbers: ox, oy, oz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz.
- `box_len`: Must be 9.
- `types`: Atom types, or NULL to store type 1 for every atom.
- `ids`: Atom ids, or NULL to store 1..n. Ids must be unique.

Returns: SEAMS_OK; SEAMS_ERR_NULL for a NULL sys, xyz, or box9; SEAMS_ERR_RANGE for n == 0 or box_len != 9; SEAMS_ERR_BOX for a non-finite cell or a non-positive edge; SEAMS_ERR_ARG for a non-finite coordinate or repeated ids; SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM; SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL.

Handle access: Non-const: replaces the stored frame. On failure the old frame stays.

Ownership: The library copies the arrays. The caller keeps them.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
const double xyz[6] = {0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0};
const double box9[9] = {0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0};
seams_status rc = seams_system_set_atoms(sys, xyz, 2, box9, 9, NULL, NULL);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_set_frame

Purpose: Store points and a general LAMMPS cell, with an int count.

ABI 1 entry. New callers use seams_system_set_atoms().

```c
seams_status seams_system_set_frame(seams_system *sys, const double *xyz, int n, const double *box9, const int *types, const int *ids);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `xyz`, `n`, `box9`, `types`, `ids`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `xyz`: n times 3 coordinates, Angstrom.
- `n`: Atom count. A non-positive count is rejected.
- `box9`: Nine cell numbers: ox, oy, oz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz.
- `types`: Types, or NULL for type 1.
- `ids`: Ids, or NULL for 1..n.

Returns: Same codes as seams_system_set_atoms().

Handle access: Non-const: replaces the stored frame. On failure the old frame stays.

Ownership: The library copies the arrays.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_status rc = seams_system_set_frame(sys, xyz, 2, box9, NULL, NULL);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_set_ortho

Purpose: Store points and an orthorhombic cell.

```c
seams_status seams_system_set_ortho(seams_system *sys, const double *xyz, int n, double ox, double oy, double oz, double lx, double ly, double lz, const int *types, const int *ids);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `xyz`, `n`, `ox`, `oy`, `oz`, `lx`, `ly`, `lz`, `types`, `ids`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `xyz`: n times 3 coordinates, Angstrom.

- `ids`: Ids, or NULL.

Returns: Same codes as seams_system_set_frame(). The tilt is zero.

Handle access: Non-const: replaces the stored frame. On failure the old frame stays.

Ownership: The library copies the arrays.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_status rc = seams_system_set_ortho(sys, xyz, 2, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, NULL, NULL);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_set_positions

Purpose: Overwrite the coordinates, and optionally the cell, of the stored frame.

Types and ids stay as stored. Per-atom labels written by an earlier seams_chill() or seams_chill_plus() are reset. On failure the frame is unchanged. By default the call checks every coordinate first and then writes them in place, which reads xyz twice and needs no extra memory. After seams_system_stage_positions(sys, 1) it reads xyz once instead (see there).

```c
seams_status seams_system_set_positions(seams_system *sys, const double *xyz, size_t n, const double *box9, size_t box_len);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `xyz`, `n`, `box9`, `box_len`.

- `sys`: Frame handle with a stored frame.
- `xyz`: n times 3 Cartesian coordinates, Angstrom. Every value must be finite.
- `n`: Atom count. Must equal the stored count.
- `box9`: New cell (ox, oy, oz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz), or NULL to keep the stored cell.
- `box_len`: 9 when box9 is not NULL; ignored otherwise.

Returns: SEAMS_OK; SEAMS_ERR_NULL for a NULL sys or xyz; SEAMS_ERR_STATE when no frame is stored; SEAMS_ERR_RANGE when n differs from the stored count or box_len != 9; SEAMS_ERR_BOX for a non-finite cell or a non-positive edge; SEAMS_ERR_ARG for a non-finite coordinate; SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM; SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL.

Handle access: Non-const: replaces the stored coordinates and cell.

Ownership: The library copies xyz and box9. The caller keeps them and may reuse the buffers as soon as the call returns.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_system_set_atoms(sys, frame0, n, box9, 9, types, NULL);
for (size_t f = 1; f < nframes; ++f) {
  seams_system_set_positions(sys, frames[f], n, NULL, 0);
  seams_chill_plus_n(sys, 3.5, 0, SEAMS_GRAPH_CUTOFF, SEAMS_CHILL_PUBLISHED,
                     labels, n, NULL);
}
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_stage_positions

Purpose: Trade memory for a single pass in seams_system_set_positions().

With enable nonzero the handle keeps a second set of per-atom records, about 72 bytes per atom. seams_system_set_positions() then checks and writes the coordinates into that set in one pass and swaps it with the stored frame when every value was finite, so a failed call still leaves the frame unchanged. The first reload after each load fills the second set from the frame. With enable 0, the default, the second set is freed. The setting survives loads.

```c
seams_status seams_system_stage_positions(seams_system *sys, int enable);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `enable`.

- `sys`: Frame handle, with or without a stored frame.
- `enable`: Nonzero to keep the second set, 0 to free it.

Returns: SEAMS_OK; SEAMS_ERR_NULL for a NULL sys.

Handle access: Non-const: changes how later reloads use memory. The stored frame is not touched.

Ownership: The library owns the second set and frees it with enable 0 or seams_system_destroy().

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_system_stage_positions(sys, 1);
for (size_t f = 1; f < nframes; ++f) {
  seams_system_set_positions(sys, frames[f], n, NULL, 0);
}
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

### seams_system_symmetry

Purpose: Per-atom ice shell label.

labels[i] is 0 for ice Ih, 1 for ice Ic, 2 for stacking disorder, or -1 when the shell does not match. A non-positive shell_rmsd selects the library ceiling (the scale-free second-shell residual, 0.15).

```c
seams_status seams_system_symmetry(seams_system *sys, double shell_rmsd, int *labels, size_t labels_len);
```

Parameters: `sys`, `shell_rmsd`, `labels`, `labels_len`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `shell_rmsd`: Positive scale-free residual ceiling, or a non-positive value for the library ceiling.
- `labels`: Caller buffer.
- `labels_len`: Must be at least the frame count.

Returns: SEAMS_OK, or SEAMS_ERR_NULL, SEAMS_ERR_STATE, SEAMS_ERR_RANGE, SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL, SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM.

Handle access: Non-const only because the call clears the handle's error slot on entry, so seams_handle_error() reports this call. It reads the frame and keeps no scratch on the handle.

Ownership: The caller owns labels.

Thread safety: Exclusive use of sys.

Units: as given for each parameter above.

Example:

```c
seams_system_symmetry(sys, 0.0, labels, n);
```

The tour call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`.

```

Parameters: `sys`, `types`, `len`.

- `sys`: Frame handle.
- `types`: Caller buffer for n ints, in stored order.
- `len`: Length of types. Must be at least n.

Returns: SEAMS_OK; SEAMS_ERR_NULL; SEAMS_ERR_STATE when no frame is stored; SEAMS_ERR_RANGE for a short buffer.

Ownership: The caller owns types.

Thread safety: Read-only: may run alongside other const calls on sys, and not alongside a non-const call on sys.
