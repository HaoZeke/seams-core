# C API

`seams.h` is ABI 1 of libseams. A handle is opaque. Coordinates are Angstrom.
A cell is nine numbers: `ox, oy, oz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz`. A zero tilt is orthorhombic.
`lx, ly, lz` are edge lengths.

`docs/examples/minimal_c.c` is the short program. `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c` calls every exported function on the in-tree fixtures.
`meson test docs_c_api_tour` compiles that file, runs it, and requires each printed
`capi` line below to match the run.

## Handle lifecycle

`seams_system_create` allocates an empty frame. The caller owns it and passes it to
`seams_system_destroy`. `NULL` is a valid argument to every destroy function.
`seams_system_set_atoms` stores points and a nine-number cell. Lengths are `size_t`.
`seams_system_set_frame` is the same store with an `int` count.
`seams_system_set_ortho` stores an orthorhombic cell. `seams_system_read` copies one
1-based frame from a trajectory. A negative type filter keeps every atom. A positive
filter keeps that species. `seams_system_count` is the number of points, or 0 for a
null handle. Neighbour, ring, cage, brine, and fingerprint handles are separate
objects. Destroying the frame does not free them.

One thread uses a handle. Another thread may use a different handle at the same time,
including for `seams_ql`, `seams_q4q6`, `seams_q6bar`, and `seams_steinhardt`: their
q_lm scratch belongs to the calling thread. `tests/capi_q_threads.c` runs them, and
CHILL+, on eight handles in eight threads.

## Status codes

`seams_status` is zero on success.

| code | value | `seams_status_string` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SEAMS_OK` | 0 | ok |
| `SEAMS_ERR_NULL` | 1 | null pointer |
| `SEAMS_ERR_RANGE` | 2 | value out of range |
| `SEAMS_ERR_BOX` | 3 | box is not a positive cell |
| `SEAMS_ERR_ARG` | 4 | bad argument |
| `SEAMS_ERR_STATE` | 5 | system has no frame |
| `SEAMS_ERR_NOMEM` | 6 | out of memory |
| `SEAMS_ERR_INTERNAL` | 7 | internal error |

No C API call aborts or exits the process. Every C++ exception is caught inside the
library and returned as one of these codes.

## Length-checked entry points

The ABI 1 calls `seams_chill_plus`, `seams_q4q6`, and `seams_rings_labels` write into
buffers without a length, and `seams_rings_histogram` takes an `int` length. New code
calls `seams_chill_plus_n`, `seams_q4q6_n`, `seams_rings_labels_n`, and
`seams_rings_histogram_n`, which take a `size_t` length for every buffer and return
`SEAMS_ERR_RANGE` when one is short. `seams_system_natoms`, `seams_neighbours_nrows`,
and `seams_rings_nrings` return their count through a `size_t` pointer and report a
null or empty handle as a status. The older calls stay exported with the same
behaviour.

## Linking

libseams is compiled with hidden visibility and a linker export list, so the only
exported symbols are the `seams_*` functions in `seams.h`. `SEAMS_API` marks them.
The library build defines `SEAMS_BUILDING`, which selects `dllexport` on Windows;
consumers get `dllimport`. Define `SEAMS_STATIC` before including `seams.h` to link
a static archive. `tests/capi_symbols.txt` is the exported list, and the
`capi_symbols` test compares it with the header and the built library.
`capi_abi` compares the exported names with `scripts/abi_baseline.txt`. When
libabigail's `abidiff` is on `PATH` at configure time, it also builds libseams once
more with debug info and compares its types with the ABI 1 corpus in
`scripts/abi_baseline.abi`: added functions pass, and anything else fails. The
`abi` pixi environment carries conda-forge's libabigail, so
`pixi run -e abi meson setup <builddir>` finds it, and the `capi-abi` CI job runs
that way. Distribution packages work too: `abigail-tools` on Debian and Ubuntu,
`libabigail` on Fedora. The corpus is format 2.4, which libabigail 2.9 and 3.0
read. Without
`abidiff`, or with an older one, `capi_abi` still checks the exported names, says
the type step was skipped, and passes.

## seams_last_error and seams_handle_error

`seams_last_error_message` and its ABI 1 spelling `seams_last_error` return the same
string. `seams_last_error` is the detail of the last failing call on this thread. A later
successful call on the same thread clears it. The storage is thread-local.
`seams_handle_error` is the copy stored on the handle that failed. A call that takes
the handle non-const clears that copy on entry. A call that takes it `const` writes the
copy only when it fails, so a successful `const` call leaves the last failure in place.
The copy stays until the next failing call or non-const call on that handle, or until
destroy. Pass `NULL` and
`seams_handle_error` returns the thread-local string. The caller does not free either
pointer.

On an empty frame, `seams_chill_plus` returns `SEAMS_ERR_STATE`. The tour prints:

```
capi seams_last_error system has no frame
capi seams_handle_error no-frame
```

## Const handles

A function that takes a `const` handle is a read-only accessor. On success it writes
nothing to the handle; on failure it writes only the error copy, under a lock. Several
threads may make `const` calls on one handle at the same time, as long as no non-const
call on that handle overlaps them. Read the message with `seams_last_error_message`
when threads share a handle. `tests/capi_const_threads.c` runs eight threads this way.

The frame accessors are `seams_system_count`, `seams_system_natoms`, `seams_system_box`,
`seams_system_positions`, `seams_system_types`, and `seams_system_ids`. Every query on
a neighbour, ring, cage, brine, or fingerprint handle is also `const`. The ring label
cache that `seams_rings_labels` fills on the first symmetry request is built once,
under a lock.

The analyses on a `seams_system` stay non-const, and each declaration in `seams.h`
says why under "Handle access":

- the loads replace the stored frame;
- `seams_chill`, `seams_chill_plus`, and `seams_chill_plus_n` write CHILL+ labels into
  the stored frame;
- the others, including `seams_ql`, `seams_q4q6`, `seams_q4q6_n`, `seams_q6bar`, and
  `seams_steinhardt`, keep no scratch on the handle, and are non-const only because
  they clear the error copy on entry, which is what lets `seams_handle_error` report
  that call. The q_lm scratch of the q calls belongs to the calling thread.

## Reloading a frame

`seams_system_set_atoms` reuses the storage of the frame it replaces. When the ids
are `NULL`, or 1 to n in order, and the atom count is unchanged, it also keeps the id
index. `seams_system_set_positions` overwrites only the coordinates, and optionally
the cell, for a frame of the same atom count; types and ids stay. A trajectory loop
calls `seams_system_set_atoms` once and `seams_system_set_positions` for each later
frame. There is no borrowed-pointer load. Every analysis reads the library's per-atom
records, so a view onto caller memory would be copied on every analysis call instead
of once per frame. A failed load or reload leaves the earlier frame in place.
`seams_system_set_positions` keeps that guarantee by writing into a second set of
per-atom records on the handle, checked in the same pass, and swapping it in at the
end. The first reload after a load fills that set from the frame; later reloads
cost about as much as writing the coordinates in place, at twice the per-atom
memory.

## Threads

`seams_set_num_threads(1)` selects one OpenMP thread. `seams_set_num_threads(0)`
restores the library default. A negative width returns `SEAMS_ERR_RANGE`.
`seams_get_num_threads` reports the width the next call will use.
`seams_set_num_threads` is process-global. Do not call it while another thread is
inside `seams_get_num_threads`.

## What the tour runs

The eight-atom cell is the diamond in `docs/examples/ice.c`. Every atom is cubic.
`input/traj/ice1h.lammpstrj` is the 128-oxygen ice Ih cell. `input/traj/genice_sI.lammpstrj`
is the 46-oxygen sI cage. `input/traj/exampleTraj.lammpstrj` is the mixed TIP4P dump
used for hydrogen bonds, sites, and domains. The cutoff is 3.5 angstroms unless a
line below says otherwise.

## Functions


### seams_abi

The call is in `docs/examples/c_api_tour.c`. The run prints:

`seams_chill_plus` writes one label per atom and, when `counts9` is not null, nine
population counts. `rule` is `SEAMS_CHILL_PUBLISHED` (four closest neighbours in
q_lm, Nguyen and Molinero equation 1) or `SEAMS_CHILL_OVITO` (every neighbour
inside the cutoff). `seams_label_name` maps a label to cubic, hexagonal, water,
interfacial, clathrate, interClathrate, unclassified, reCubic, or reHex.
